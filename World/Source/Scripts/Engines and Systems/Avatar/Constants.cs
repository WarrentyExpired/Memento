If you draw this card, your story begins at this gypsy encampment in the forest, where fate has gathered you before you are cast into Vaelen. Here you are weak and nearly bereft of skill, yet you carry a blessed tome called The Avatar's Ascent.<br><br>Before you leave this sanctuary, choose a Template to guide your rebirth, and consider your Ascensions carefully. Ascensions are permanent gifts to your lineage that may preserve knowledge between lives, unlock greater potential, or soften the harsh truth that awaits you outside these lanterns. Unless an Ascension says otherwise, everything you own is lost when you die, and you cannot be resurrected as others are.<br><br>Death will end your current life and return you here to begin anew, while the coins you farmed are banked for your next preparations. Your house alone may endure, passed to whoever inherits your name. Once you step beyond the encampment, you may read your tome but you may purchase nothing more from it until fate brings you back.<br><br>This is a challenging journey of self-discovery. Each run is temporary; each death is a lesson. Those who endure may raise their stat and skill ceilings, master Primary and Secondary skills from past lives, and someday claim vengeance against the faction that wronged their family. Will you begin the Avatar's Ascent?";
